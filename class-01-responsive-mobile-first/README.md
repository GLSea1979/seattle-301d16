## Today's Plan

*Note: Our general plan for 301 will be to take two 10/15-minute breaks during class each day, with a finish time of 12:30.*

- Kickoff/introductions (not sure how long this will take; if possible we'll start with MVC before time for the first break)

	- Let's develop some mobile/responsive super-powers!
	- With a pair, make the blog responsive, so it hides the main navigation menu under a "Hamburger" link on small screens, and unfurls to a row of tab-like links on larger screens.
	- Then, see how you can apply these same ideas in your portfolio!
